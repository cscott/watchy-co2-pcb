watchy-co2-pcb
==============
A small 10.3mm x 17mm PCB to mount the
[Sensirion SCD40 CO<sub>2</sub> sensor](https://www.sensirion.com/en/environmental-sensors/carbon-dioxide-sensors/carbon-dioxide-sensor-scd4x/)
on.  It contains footprints to optionally add a
3.3v linear regulator and some extra capacitors to better decouple the
power supply, and a solder jumper to allow disabling power to the SCD40
via GPIO to save some additional power.

This board is built using kicad 5.
